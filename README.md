##Bar In Mind

Bar In Mind is an application designed to allow D.C. residents to collect and store data on the best bars in each neighborhood so they can use it as a reference when making plans. They can collaboratively add bars and neighborhoods to the database, and can rate and comment on bars that have already been created.
